alghad:

NOTE: Encoding is "Arabic - Windows 1256"

grab title from 3rd line (starts with <title> tag)
title will have "jareedat alghad - "

to get to the body, skip everything until you find
<!-- AddThis Button END -->

then for each line, take content between <P> and </P>
when you reach a line that does start with <P> (even after spaces), you are done

note: the first line usually has a <STRONG>...</STRONG> tag, usually indicating location.
      other <STRONG> should be preserved as well, but other HTML tags should be discarded
note: the last line usually has other stuff after the </P> ... they're not needed



alriyadh #1: (most files; ending in html)

grab title from 59th line (starts with <title> tag)
title will have "jareedat alriyadh :"

grab date and issue from 154th line
(couple of lines after line starting with <div id="date")

at some point (278th line) you will encounter
<div id="article-view">

now start looking for <h2> and <h1> tags

after that look for <p> ... </p> portions of the lines
(one might contain author info, within <p class="author">)

but you should ignore things that have <span class=quote> (these are quotes)

also ignore content that has <div class="img_title"> because that's a caption for an image

also note that sometimes the line is empty after discarding <p> and </p>

continue to do this until reaching
<br clear="all" />
(alternatively, something that contains <!-- article-view -->)


alriyadh #2: (some files; not ending in html, renamed to contain "net")

grab title from 41st line (starts with <title> tag)
title will have "alriyadh net" ... might be empty?

grab date and time from 171st line
(starts with <div class="date")

at some point (113th line) you will encounter
<div class="box1 ">

now start looking for <h2> and <h1> tags

then look for an "author" <div> that has location/agency info
(<div class="author">)

after that look for <p> ... </p> portions of the lines

but you should ignore things that have <span class=quote> (these are quotes)

also ignore content that has <div class="img_title"> because that's a caption for an image

continue to do this until reaching
<script type="text/javascript">




al-youm al-sabe:

NOTE: Encoding is "Arabic - Windows 1256"

grab title from 9th line (in between <title> and </title> tags on 6th and 12th lines)
title will have "alyom alsab3"

at some point (271st line) you will encounter
            <div id="newsContent">

now start looking for <h3> and <h2> tags

grab date and time somewhere in the 275th-280th lines region
(starts with \\s+ <p class="newsStoryDate">)

if date has year 1899, it's an empty page

there might be a <p class="newsStoryEditor"> for the author

skip several more lines, including:

<!-- AddThis Button END -->
<!-- sport advertise -->
<!-- end sport advertise -->
</div>

then you will see the story in lines ending with <br>
  the first line will start with <p>
  the last line might not end in <br>
  there's also an extra <br> between lines
  there will eventually be a </p>
NOTE: in EditPlus, the story seems like it's contained within a single(!) line

other things in html tags should be ignored(?) such as <param...> and <object...>
(this is likely rare)

this is followed by
                        </div>
						<div>
						<!-- sport ads website -->

...and indicates the end.
